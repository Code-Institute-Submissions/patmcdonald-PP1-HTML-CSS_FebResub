## Initial content of this file

This will be a knitting website.
My plan is to create a website promoting knitting as an accessible activity for anyone.
I'll also emphasise how knitting is a creative and mindful practice.

### I have been trying to get make my CSS render on Gitpod - It's not working at present, so I'm submitting my project as it stands
